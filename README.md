# Overview
**simple shell** is a command-line interpreter that replicates the functionalities that the Unix shell provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is an interactive command language and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
# how to get
Clone this repository [link](https://github.com/yacinekedidi/simple_shell.gi "link")  to your local system and compile using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c.
# How to use
once you enter the shell you can run your executable and use it similarly to the standard sh.
# main features
